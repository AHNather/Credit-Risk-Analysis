# Credit Risk Analysis

This repository contains the Excel-based reports used for assessing credit risk and projecting future losses in a financial institution. The reports created include:

- **Vintage Analysis Report**: Analyzes how accounts' statuses change over time based on the number of months theyâ€™ve been active. This helps in predicting future delinquencies and defaults.

- **Roll Rate Report**: Tracks the migration of delinquent accounts through different stages, such as from Current to Delinquent or Charged-Off. This report is used to assess credit risk based on customer demographics and behavior.

- **Loss Provisioning Report**: Projects future losses by analyzing historical data and applying forecasting techniques to estimate how many accounts will likely end up in default, and how much loss the company can expect.

- **New Growth Forecasting**: Uses historical account performance to forecast the number of new accounts that will likely be charged-off in the future. This report helps in projecting the performance of new loans or accounts under similar demographic conditions.
